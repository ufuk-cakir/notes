# Definition

> [!info]
> Given two manifolds $M$ and $N$, a differentiable map $f: M \rightarrow N$ is called a diffeomorphism if it is a bijection and its inverse $f^{-1}: N \rightarrow M$ is differentiable as well. If these functions are $r$ times continuously differentiable, $f$ is called a $C^r$-diffeomorphism. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism))
