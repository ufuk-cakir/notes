Procedural Programming is a [[notes/python/Programming Paradigm|Programming Paradigm]].
The idea is to get things done in a sequence of steps i.e think of the code as a step-by-steo course of action that needs to be executed. The code is not organized in logical groups or objects, we just think of the different things that need to be done and then write the code. 

# Key aspects
- data and methods are two entitites
- we can also include functions
- follows a linear, top-down approach

# Advantages
- good choice for general purpose programming
- simple, intuitive and straightforward way to right sequential code

# Disadvantages
- not reusable: need to replicate the code implementation across different programs
- not easy to scale
