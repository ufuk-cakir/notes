# Fragen:
-  What is variational Inference?
- Why is posterior approximation in variational inference a disadvantage
- inferential and variational methods difference
- 








# Notes on Paper:
- variational methods have huge succes and ongoing advances, but have a number of disadvantges. One main limitation is the choice of posterior approximation that is adressed in the paper
- Variational Inferences requires that intractable posterior distributions be approximated by class of known Probability distributions, over which we search for the true posterior
	- class of approximations is limited: i.e mean field approximation, implies that no solution is ever able to resemble true posterior distribution
- Why are we interested in richer more faithful posterior approximations
	- evidence that it results in better performance.
- Proposals for rich posterior approximations:
	-
