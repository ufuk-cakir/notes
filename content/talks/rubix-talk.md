In this talk at the AstroAI Group meeting, I presented my master thesis called RUBIX (Reconstruction Using Bayesian Inference Experiments).

RUBIX is a fully tested, well-documented, and modular tool developed
in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations
across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-
the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from
hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX‚Äôs auto-differentiation capabilities
to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the
entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g.
gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters.
